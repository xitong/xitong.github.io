      <h1>SIGIR Tips (by @peter_r_bailey)</h1>
      <p>I compiled a series of short SIGIR tips posted by @<a href=https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey>peter_r_bailey</a> on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307227628476182528">#</a>). I  hope computer science researchers who aim at getting paper published in SIGIR (or other SIGs, top-tier conferences) would benefit.</p>

      <p>
      Tip 1. Titles describe the paper; don't mislead, overpromise, or be unduly punny. Less is more. A tweet's length is too long.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307228856211869696">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 2. Abstracts summarize the paper. In 1 short paragraph. Subject. Motivation. Goal. Method. Achievement. Make me want to read.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307230532113166336">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 3. Intro: What are you doing? Why is it interesting and novel? Will I learn something in the next hour? 1/2 to 3/4 page max.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307245973841788929">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 4. Related Work. 30-40 citations is sweet spot; less means you don't know the area. Don't omit key works from other people.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307247324743225344">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 5. Report experimental results with appropriate statistical info like error bars, confidence intervals, effect size. Please.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307556319055970304">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>Tip 6. ML is a means to an end, not the main meal. Feature engineering is only interesting if it gives insights on user behavior.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/307854972417081345">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 7. Use Greek letters and maths/stats for precision and brevity. Explain intuitions in English. Don't assume familiarity.

      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 8. Unless space-constrained, put lead author's name before citation cross-ref, so I don't have to flip back and forth always.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308023656431374336">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 9. Citations. Run cross-ref update in Latex or Word before final submission. Check author names' spelling; they might review!

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308032781353635841">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 10. If evaluating with a test collection, use more than 1. Don't use pre 2000 exclusively. There's more to life than ad hoc.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308349406581764096">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 11. Working with big log data doesn't make it interesting. Insights make it interesting. Especially ones which generalize.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308350697970212864">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 12. Building real IR systems involves much compromise. Don't overclaim for your new algorithm unless you've already tried it.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308354361766064128">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 13. What's product interesting is not always research interesting, and vice versa. What's both is not always publishable.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308354969902395393">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 14. Graphics. Make legends readable when printed on paper. If color essential to interpret output, make note in fig caption.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308379781471289344">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 15. When selecting data to exclude, describe what you did and why. Otherwise it's not clear what the bias in dataset will be.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308381358223392768">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip16. Negative results can be interesting. What didn't work, and why not? Surely not all expts led directly to success? #dreamon

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308382153551527937">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 17. Your first audience is overworked, on a deadline, tired, had a glass of wine and put the kids to bed. That is your prior.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308447421237690368">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 18. Two words: Strunk and White. Read then follow: Rules of usage. Principles of composition. Matters of form. Misused words.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308667822953877504">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 19. Don't pad out with lower quality work. >4:5 papers are rejected. Many great 8 page papers in past. Make it all shine.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/308673636699631618">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 20. Make your contributions clear. Both at the start and end of the paper. Also, Conclusions are not a summary. What changes?

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/309081919071612928">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 21. Co-author with people smarter than you. You'll learn from them. They likely have skills you don't have. Best, it's fun!

      <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_r_bailey/status/309082867214974977">#</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      Tip 22. Acknowledge those who helped you out. Thanks cost little, while forgetting may offend. If big help, make them a co-author

      <p>
      Tips &lt;end/&gt; Thanks for all the feedback, hope you enjoyed them. What did I miss? What do you most love/hate in SIGIR papers?

      Tips &lt;thanks&gt; Big shout out to many colleagues over years, especially to Dave Hawking, Nick Craswell, Ryen White &amp; Susan Dumais.
